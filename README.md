# BlackJack
A Simple Black Jack Game made in collaboration with 2 colleagues
The cards are stored in an ArrayList that's shuffeled everytime you instantiate the game or choose to. The actuall available cards 
type are stored in ENUM class. Almost everything is made with objects. That interact with eachother to make the game possible. The main
class ( Game.java ) is the brain that puts all the pieces of the puzzle together.

NOTE: The program will do error checking at every step of the game.

Built with: Java 8
